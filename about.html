                Welcome to VITS NotesHub – your personal study companion designed to help students for study material and exams, to achieve their academic. VITS NotesHub is here to guide you every step of the way. <br><br><br><br>
                We started thinking about ideas behind the VITSNotesHub project. At that time I switched multiple note-taking apps. I wanted the app with the robust support of Markdown because it allows me easily migrate my data if needed and strictly control formatting. On the other hand, I wanted seamless cross-device sync support without a monthly subscription fee and, ideally, fully control my data without being strictly tied to a single particular vendor. we have not found any application that would satisfy all my requirements. The solution was obvious, create our own. <br><br><br><br>
                Our mission is to make learning efficient and enjoyable by offering tools that simplify the study process. Which is why we’ve developed VITSNotesHub to streamline your study sessions and boost productivity. <br><br><br><br>
                We’re a team of Students and developers, who are passionate about creating tools that enhance the learning experience. VITS NotesHub was born out of a desire to make studying smarter and more efficient. <br><br><br><br>
                Even though many things changed since then, the main principles remain intact. Simplicity without sacrificing functionality, rich Markdown editing, support of multiple sources for your notes (hence the name VITSNotesHub), cross-platform support. <br><br><br><br>
                I hope you will enjoy using VITSNotesHub as much as I'm enjoying developing it. Let the story continue. <br><br><br><br> <hr>
